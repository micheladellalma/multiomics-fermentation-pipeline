# multiomics-fermentation-pipeline

## Overview
MuliOmicsFermentation is a workflow for identifying the dynamics of microorganisms, pathways and metabolites throughout the fermentation process.
The final output is a multi-layered network, where each layer corresponds to a different time point during fermentation.

This workflow leverages multiple programming languages, including R, Python, and Bash.

Below is an image illustrating the initial inputs and the final table used to construct the network:

## :twisted_rightwards_arrows: Workflow overview
In reality in the middle, there are many more steps...
summarized in the following diagram:

Among the different steps of the pipeline:

1. **Preprocessing** of the data
2. **Taxonomic classification** and **differential abundance** of taxa between time points
3. **Discovering** of the **pathways** potentially expressed and definition of the pathways enriched for each time point
4. **Metabolites classification** into chemical groups and search for enriched metabolites per time point
5. **Integration** of all the data and **Network analysis**

## How to use
There is the master script that orchestrate all the scripts that have to be used, it is important to put in the master script the input files required, 
and to create a specific tree of directories (starting from the working directory), that is explained in the master script before each command.

The output of the scripts are figures and tables and will be saved in the correspondent folders at each stage of the analysis.

## Repository structure
- /scripts folder contains only executable codes from the command line.
- /notebook folder contains Rmd and Jupyter analysis with descriptive parts and figures.
- /data folder contains all the data. (available only in the private version of this repository)
